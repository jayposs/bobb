Linux (Ubuntu 24) Server Setup on DigitalOcean

Note - Google AI response works pretty well now and follows most of the directions below.

I'm not a linux expert, so these instructions may not be the best.
I got tired of Googling all this stuff everytime I setup a server.

Directions below work for linux or osx client using terminal.
For windows client, consider - Windows Subsystem For Linux (WSL). 
I have not used WSL, but sounds like a good approach.

This setup uses ssh with key files to login from client device to server. 

1. create .ssh directory on client (if not already exists)
    > cd ~
    > mkdir .ssh
    change directory persmission to 700 (read, write, execute owner only) 
    > chmod 700 .ssh 
    > cd .ssh  (handy to be in the .ssh directory for next steps)     
    
2. create SSH key file pair on client (private & public files)
    > ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "comment" 
    comment is added to end of the public key
    use default file name or enter one that identifies key files more uniquely
    NOTE - a passphrase is recommended, but I don't usually use one.
    When executing utils like rsync, using a passphrase complicates things.
    
3. Create Droplet on DigitalOcean
    Authentication Method - SSH Key
    Choose "New SSH Key" - Copy/Paste Public Key (.pub) from client (created above)
    Can use > cat keyfilename.pub to display value. Then copy it.
    
4. When server is created:
    root user is setup
    ssh public key is auto copied to /root/.ssh/authorized_keys

5. login to server from client using ssh
    > ssh root@server.ip.address -i name_of_local_private_ssh_key_file
    example:
    > ssh root@12.345.678.90 -i id_ed25519
    
You can also use the web terminal feature DigitalOcean provides.    
    
6. create user on server (don't want to work with root normally) 
   using root on server
   > adduser jimski   (note - don't use cmd useradd) 
   > usermod -aG sudo jimski (user jimski added to sudo group for root privileges) 
   
I usually change path and terminal prompt settings in ~/.bashrc file
   
7. Add ssh public key to new user's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file
   You can use the ssh-copy-id command, but that may require enabling password
   authentication on the server. Google for more info on that option. 

   The following steps add ssh public key in a more manual way.
   Should still be logged in as root on server.   
     
   Use su command to switch to the new user.
   > su jimski  (enter passwd used previously to setup this user) 
   Create .ssh dir and authorized_keys file
   > cd ~
   > mkdir .ssh
   > chmod 700 .ssh
   > cd .ssh
   Copy ssh public key to authorized_keys file. May want to use different method. 
   > nano authorized_keys
   > paste public key file from client .pub file (same as step3 above)
   > save & exit
   > chmod 600 authorized_keys  (read/write permission for owner only)
   > exit (switch back to root)
   > exit (logout of server)

You could also copy authorized_keys file from /root/.ssh as root user
but would have to make sure owner is changed to new user.

8. Add ssh connection info to ~/.ssh/config file on client device
   Simplifies connecting to server from client.
   > cd ~/.ssh
   > nano config   (use whatever text editor is convenient)
   > add entries for each user:server 
     example entry
        host server1   (use whatever you want for host identifier)
            HostName 12.345.678.90  (ip address of server)
            User jimski   (looks for pub key in /home/jimski/.ssh/authorized_keys)
            IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519  (private key file on client)
   > save         

9. Connect to server from client using entry in .ssh/config.
   > ssh server1
   
Permission Levels:
    directory .ssh - 700 (owner-rwx) 
    private key file - 600 (owner-rw)
    public key file - 644 (owner-rw, group-r, other-r)
    authorized_keys - 600 (owner-rw) 
     
Other Steps To consider
    setup firewall to limit ip addresses than can connect through ssh port 22

Install Go
    1. cd to dir where tar.gz file will be downloaded: ex. cd ~/downloads
    2. download tar.gz file: wget https://golang.org/dl/go1.25.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz  (change to desired version)
    3. remove previously installed version: sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go
    4. install new version: sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.25.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
    5. add to ~/.bashrc: export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin  (requires relogin to activate)

Hopefully I got these instructions right.
