I'm not a Linux expert, but these commands may be useful.

start pgm in background

    > ./bobb_server &  (starting from binary)
    > go run . & (starting from source)

    if starting with sudo, can use:
    > sudo -b ./bobb_server  (disown not required when exiting terminal)

see background jobs
> jobs -l

bring back to foreground
> fg %jobnumber  (ex. fg %1)

send foreground process to background
> ctrl-z  (allows command to be issued)
> bg %jobnumber 

disconnect from terminal session (keeps bg jobs running after exit)
> disown %jobnumber    (will no longer display in jobs)

to see if server is running and get process id if needed
> ps -e | grep bobb  

to normally shutdown bobb_server (ok if server disowned & running in bkgrnd)
> cd bobb/scripts 
> ./down.sh  (pauses 10 secs to allow any running processes to finish)

to force process to end
> kill -9 pid   (process id)
