Install, Verify, Use Instructions 

Note - I am not an expert on best ways to setup Go programs.
The following steps worked for me using Linux system. 

Bobb is not just a package to be used by other Go programs.
It is a module with multiple packages and executable programs.

Go version 1.22 or higher is required.  

This process installs all source code to your local system.

The clone process creates a subdirectoy called bobb inside the current directory.

1. clone git repo: git clone https://github.com/jayposs/bobb.git  
2. cd to bobb directory    
3. run go mod tidy - should get bbolt and fastjson
4. cd to bobb_server sub directory
5. confirm bobb_settings.json are ok
6. start server - go run .  (or compile and use binary)
   verify "waiting for requests ..." is displayed    
7. open new terminal window (or put server to background**)
8. cd to demo sub directory   
9. run demo pgm - go run . 
   verify "Demo Pgm Finished Successfully" is displayed  
   Note - port in bobb_settings.json, must match bo.BaseURL in demo.go
   
**To put server to background
1. ctrl-z   (stops foreground process, allows entry of command)
2. bg       (puts process to background)
3. jobs -l  (shows list of running job ids preceded by job number)  
4. fg %jobnumber (brings server back to foreground)
see linux_notes.txt for more info    
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To see standard Go doc in browser, after cloning Bobb: 
1. install godoc, if not already (google for directions)
2. cd to bobb directory
3. godoc -http=localhost:6060
4. in browser, open localhost:6060
5. under Packages, select Third party

CLIENT PROGRAMS (using locally installed Bobb module)

Your client program modules need the following line in their module's go.mod file:
   replace github.com/jayposs/bobb => /home/username/bobb  (location of bobb module)

Example steps 
> mkdir bobbtest
> cd bobbtest
> go mod init bobbtest
add the replace line as shown below to go.mod file
> mkdir pgm1
> cd pgm1
> create new program, pgm1.go, that uses bobb
> run go mod tidy

Contents of go.mod after these steps.

   module bobbtest

   go 1.25.0

   replace github.com/jayposs/bobb => /home/jay/bobb    (change local path as needed)

   require github.com/jayposs/bobb v0.0.0

   require (
      github.com/valyala/fastjson v1.6.4 // indirect
      go.etcd.io/bbolt v1.3.8 // indirect
      golang.org/x/sys v0.4.0 // indirect
   )
