Add Your Own Requests to Bobb

1. Create new Requests file located in bobb top level folder.
    Use standard requests file as an example, such as requests_get.go.
    Each request must meet the Requests interface type as defined in types.go.

2. Add routing to customRoutes() func in bobb_server/routes_custom.go  

3. Add codes such as new Op code.     
    See codes.go for standard codes.
    Place your codes either in new Requests file or a new file with just your codes.

When installing new version of Bobb be sure to keep these changes.
